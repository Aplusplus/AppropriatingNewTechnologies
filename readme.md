# Appropriating New Technologies
**Friday 9:30 am to 12:00 pm, Spring 2012**

## Course Description

What do you want your world to look like? This class will focus on creating the future by appropriating new technologies with openFrameworks. openFrameworks is a C++ toolkit designed by a global community of media artists, with an emphasis on real time interaction. Because it's C++, it provides an easy bridge to a huge variety of low level tools like OpenCV and FaceTracker -- which makes it easier to develop otherwise impossible projects, like the EyeWriter, or to explore cutting-edge ideas like real time face substitution. In this class, we'll work with technologies surrounding face tracking, eye tracking, 3d scanning, computer security, privacy, and sharing. We'll spend a lot of time understanding the intricacies of openFrameworks, with the goal of creating seamless, mind-blowing experiments, installations, and performance pieces that hijack new technologies to create the future we want to see. Prerequisites: A deep love for code, an intense passion for democratization of technology, and the ability to geek out when necessary. Or, at least, Introduction to Computational Media. This two-point course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester.

### Appropriated

[US Army uses XBox 360 Controller to fly UAVs](http://www.pyrosoft.co.uk/blog/2007/11/04/army-fly-uav-spy-plane-with-xbox-360-controller/)

[What is in a name?](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4713.en.html) A historical overview, showing "a name never was ones own but always an intersection of administrative, media-technical and personal interventions".

[The Kinect Effect](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Kinect/Kinect-Effect) is a rare case of a product being appropriated, and then re-appropriated by the creators. Also see, as responses [Microsoft Bets Big on Kinect for Windows](www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/01/microsoft-bets-kinect-windows/) and [Microsoft Unleashes The Kinect And Promptly Misses The Point](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665827/microsoft-unleashes-the-kinect-and-promptly-misses-the-point).

[Graffiti Markup Language](http://www.graffitimarkuplanguage.com) (GML) uses XML to describe information that would traditionally not have been described with XML.

[EyeWriter](http://www.eyewriter.org/) uses eye tracking for a novel purposes: enabling graffiti artists. Eye tracking was originally developed for the air force.

[Video Toaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_K8vnx2ZDc) was like the Kinect in that it brought a previously inaccessible technology to a lower price. The interesting thing is the marketing campaign surrounding it: they were genuinely interested in selling it on the idea of bringing down the large networks.

[Warhol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14) was a master of appropriation, all the way down to the Amiga.

Chat Roulette is a unique platform for interactive media and performance. See [FaceFlip](http://vimeo.com/10191761) and [Mario Prank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=OTC2I1lHnS4).

### Waiting to be Appropriated

[Biometric security, especially face detection](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/11/apple-wins-secret-patent-for-high-end-3d-object-recognition.html)

["Avoid ghetto" Bing maps feature](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57354445-71/the-joy-of-microsofts-avoid-ghetto-gps-patent/) What kind of routes might you suggest?

### Hacking

[Does Hacktivism Matter?](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4749.en.html)

[Supervillainizer](http://www.anninaruest.com/a/supervillainizer/index.html) created networks of conspirators to distract intelligence organizations.

The [Metrocard](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/765.en.html) has been reversed. ITP students have used this to create [MetroChange](http://metrochange.org/).

### Crowdsourcing

[Macro Dragnets](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4813.en.html) and [Asking the public to identify criminals](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/london-police-use-flickr-to-identify-looters/).
